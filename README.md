# Thomas Fire Impact: Air Quality Index Trends and False Imagery Assessment

## Purpose

In 2017, Santa Barbara and Ventura county suffered the 7th largest wildfire in the history of California. Almost 300,000 acres were burned and caused more than 150 million in damages across both counties. The purpose of this repsoitiory is to show the the damages of the Thomas fire in two different ways. We will plot the trend of AQI over a 5 day average to see how it affected the air quality in December of 2017. Next we will map out Santa Barbara County and layer over the Thomas Fire perimeter showing the extent of the land that was burned.
